# Agile

## Origin

Agile grew out of a predominant development environment in which projects and their timelines were rigidly planned at the beginning of the process. As the name suggests, Agile allows the planning process to iteratively change throughout development.

## According to Atlassian

Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

## Agile Values

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Responding to change over following a plan
