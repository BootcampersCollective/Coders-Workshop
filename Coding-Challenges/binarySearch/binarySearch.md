You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes. 
Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" 
and "right," respectively. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: 
its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to 
the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None 
(null) values. You are also given a target integer value; write a function that finds the closest value to 
that target value contained in the BST. Assume that there will only be one closest value.
