# Check if Sparse

We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary representation. For example, 21 (10101) is sparse, but 22 (10110) is not. For a given input `N`, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to `N`.

Extra challenge: do this in faster than O(N log N) time.
