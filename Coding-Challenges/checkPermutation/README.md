# Check Permutation

Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

After you have a "brute-force" solution, attempt to solve this problem in O(n) -- linear -- time.

A string is a permutation of another if it has the same characters in a rearranged order.

When dealing with strings, it is wise to seek clarification on case-sensitivity, whitespace, and character encoding. For this problem, assume case-sensitivity, count whitespace, and assume a UTF-8 encoding. 

For example, inputs "dog" and "god" should return true, while "God" and "dog" should return false; "dog " and "god" should also return false.
