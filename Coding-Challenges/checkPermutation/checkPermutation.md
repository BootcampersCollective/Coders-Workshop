# Check Permutation

> Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

> A string is a permutation of another if it has the same characters in a rearranged order.

When dealing with strings, it is wise to seek clarification on case-sensitivity and whitespace. For this problem, assume case-sensitivity and count whitespace. 

For example, inputs "dog" and "god" should return true, while "God" and "dog" should return false; "dog " and "god" should also return false.

Attempt to solve this problem in O(n) -- linear -- time.
