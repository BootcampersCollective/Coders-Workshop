# Convert Roman Numerals

Given a number in Roman numeral format, convert it to Arabic.

The values of Roman numerals are as follows:

```json
{
  "M": 1000,
  "D": 500,
  "C": 100,
  "L": 50,
  "X": 10,
  "V": 5,
  "I": 1
}
```

In addition, note that the Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for numbers such as IV and XL.

For the input `"XIV"`, for instance, you should return `14`.
