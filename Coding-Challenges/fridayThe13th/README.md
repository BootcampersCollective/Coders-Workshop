# Friday the 13th

Friday 13th or Black Friday is considered an unlucky day.

Write a function to calculate how many unlucky days are in the given year.

For example, given `2015`, your function should return `3`; for `1986`, return `1`; and for `2132`, return `1`.

Follow-up: When will the *next* Friday the 13th be?
