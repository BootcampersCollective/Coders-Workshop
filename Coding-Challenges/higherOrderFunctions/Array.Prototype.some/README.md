# Array.Prototype.some

Implement the method `Array.Prototype.some()` according to the [MDN spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some). The method can be run independently of the array upon which it is acting.

E.g. `some([1, 2, 3], (val) => val < 2)` should return `true`.

Follow-up: Implement `some` using `reduce`.
