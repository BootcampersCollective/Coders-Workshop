# Implement reduceWhile

Like reduce, `reduceWhile` returns a single item by iterating through the list, successively calling the iterator function. `reduceWhile` also takes a predicate that is evaluated before each step. If the predicate returns false, it "short-circuits" the iteration and returns the current value of the accumulator.
