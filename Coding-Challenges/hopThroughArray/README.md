# Hop Through an Array

Given an array where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach the last index starting at index 0.

For example, [2, 0, 1, 0] returns True while [1, 1, 0, 1] returns False.

Follow-up: what if each number, `n`, represents the **max** number of hops you can make? i.e. you can make `0` to `n` hops.
