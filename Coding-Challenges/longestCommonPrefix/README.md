# Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.

For example, input `["flower","flow","flight"]` should return `"fl"` since "fl" is the longest common prefix among all the strings.

Input `["deer","drought","drink"]` should return `"d"`.

Input `["dog","racecar","car"]` should return `""` since there are no common prefixes among the strings.
