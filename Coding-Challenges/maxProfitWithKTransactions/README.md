# Max Profit (with K Transactions)

You are given an array of integers representing the prices of a single stock on various days (each index in the array represents a different day).

You are also given a integer `k`, which represents the number of transactions you are allowed to make. One transaction consists of buying the stock on a given day and selling it on another, later day. Write a function that returns the maximum profit that you can make buying and selling the stock, given `k` transactions. Note that you can only hold 1 share of the stock at time; in other words, you cannot buy more than 1 share of the stock on any given day, and you cannot buy a share of the stock if you are still holding another share.
