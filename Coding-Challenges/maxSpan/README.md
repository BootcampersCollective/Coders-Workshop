# maxSpan

Consider the leftmost and rightmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the "span" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. A single value has a span of 1. Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)

```javascript
maxSpan([1, 2, 1, 1, 3]) // 4
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 1, 4]) // 6
maxSpan([1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 4, 4]) // 6
```
