# Permutation of a Palindrome

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.  

A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.  

For example, input 'racecar' or 'tactcoa' should return `true`, while 'kitten' should return `false`.
