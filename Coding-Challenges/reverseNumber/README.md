# Reverse Number

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse the digits.

Examples:

```
Input: 123
Output: 321
```
```
Input: -123
Output: -321
```
```
Input: 120
Output: 21
```

Note: Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2<sup>31</sup>,  2<sup>31</sup> − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
