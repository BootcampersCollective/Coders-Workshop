# Two Sum

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Example

Given `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`, return `[0, 1]` because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`.
