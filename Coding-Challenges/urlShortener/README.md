# Implement a URL Shortener

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

`shorten(url)`, which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as zLg6wl.

`restore(short)`, which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return null.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?
